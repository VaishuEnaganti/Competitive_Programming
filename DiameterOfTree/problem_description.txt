Diameter of a Tree

Given an array of unique elements, construct a Binary Search Tree(BST) and
find the diameter of the tree. Diameter is defined as the number of nodes
on the longest path between 2 nodes of the tree.


Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by 2T
lines. First line of each test case contains N - number of nodes in the
BST. The next line contains N unique integers - value of the nodes.


Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 5000
0 <= ar[i] <= 10000


Output Format

For each test case, print the diameter of the Binary Search Tree, separated
by newline.
